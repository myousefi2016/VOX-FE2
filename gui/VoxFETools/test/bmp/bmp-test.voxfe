# Load a 3D image from a png/bmp stack. The format here is:
# LOAD_IMAGE C-printf-specifier
# The specifier, in brief, is of the form: name%NNNN.bmp
# where NNNN indicates each file number. In this case:
#   % -- indicates the beginning of the numeric identifier
#   d -- indicates a decimal integer (and will probably always have to be so here)
#   1 -- as here shows that there that the numeric identifier is only one character wide
#        at its smallest, ie. it is not padded by spaces or zeros
#   0 -- if a zero is given, eg. %03d, then we know that the numeric identifier is 3
#        characters wide *and* padded by zeros such as , 001, 002,... 012,  etc
#
# A good source to read up on the printf spec is: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/
# And see the note at:-
#    http://itk.org/ITKExamples/src/IO/ImageBase/CreateAListOfFileNames/Documentation.html
# to see how this is really being employed here.
#
# If bmp files are being used, then the VOXEL_SIZE line is also needed. 
# Since voxels are assumed to be cubic in VoxFE, we only need the dimension of one side.
